## <a name="about">About cycADa</a>

__cycADa__ (or _cython based algorthmic differentiation_) 
is a tool for _algorithmic (smooth and piecewise)
differentiation_ (sometimes also refered to as 
_automatic (smooth and piecewise) differentiation_) by 
operator overloading in __c++__ for the use in __python__ 
(i.e. __cycADa__ can be used in either language, but it was primarily developed 
and tuned for the use in __python__).

__cycADa__ offers _1st order_ _sparse_ _forward mode_ for the computation of 
 * secant __CSR__-matrices
 * Jacobian __CSR__-matrices (__note__: special case of secant mode)
 * _secant_ piecewise linear operators in block __CSR__-matrix form
   referred to as _Abs-Linear Form_ or ALF
   (__note__: for piecewise differentiable functions)
 * _tangent_ piecewise linear operators in block __CSR__-matrix form 
   referred to as _Abs-Linear Form_ or ALF
   (__note__: for piecewise differentiable functions and special case
   of secant mode)

By __CSR__ we refer to sparse matrices in the so called and well known 
_compressed sparse row_ format. 

Additionally and as more recent feature __cycADa__ also offers 
 * _secant forward_ smooth directional differentiation
 * _tangent forward_ smooth directional differentiation 
   (__note__: special case of secant mode)
 * _secant forward_ piecewise smooth directional differentiation
   (__note__: for piecewise differentiable functions)
 * _tangent forward_ piecewise smooth directional differentiation
   (__note__: for piecewise differentiable functions and special case
   of secant mode)
 * _secant reverse_ smooth directional differentiation 
   (__note__: _reverse_ mode does not exist in the piecewise smooth setting)
 * _tangent reverse_ smooth directional differentiation 
   (__note__: _reverse_ mode does not exist in the piecewise smooth setting
   and special case of secant mode)

Examples on the use of __cycADa__ from __python__ can be found 
within the /ad/cycADa/examples folder.

At its core __cycADa__ is a __c++__ program with a __cython__ shell around
to make it callable/executable/importable from __python__.
Thus the __c++__ parts need to be compiled prior first use!
As of yet there is no install option to install/configure __cycADa__ globally 
(consider it a feature). 

## <a name="maths">BRIEF Mathematical Excerpt on the Algorithmic Piecewise Differentiation of cycADa</a>

> As a general __note__: if you look for a comprehensive introduction on (smooth) 
> _algorithmic_ or _automatic differentiation_ see e.g. [Grie2008](#Grie2008). It 
> serves as theoretical foundation for the algorithmic piecewise linearization 
> as scratched or hinted herein.

With __cycADa__ you can differentiate functions  ![file_inline_0_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_0_0.png)  
that are chains of so-called elementary operations
 * differentiable, unary  ![file_inline_1_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_1_0.png)  functions 
   with Lipschitz continuous first order derivative, 
   i.e.  ![file_inline_2_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_2_0.png) 
 * absolute value function
 * a binary addition  ![file_inline_3_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_3_0.png)  
   (__note__: binary here refers to the fact that the addition takes 
   exactly two summands)
 * as well as actually 3 more binary operations that are implemented and handled 
   by __cycADa__ directly:
      - the binary subtraction  ![file_inline_4_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_4_0.png)  
      - the binary multiplication  ![file_inline_5_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_5_0.png)  
      - the binary division  ![file_inline_6_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_6_0.png)  
    
   but which for the remainder of this excerpt should be understood in 
   terms of the other elementary operations:
      - _subtraction_ (via _addition_):  ![file_inline_7_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_7_0.png) 
      - _multiplication_ (via _babylonian identity_):  ![file_inline_8_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_8_0.png)  
        (__note__: __cycADa__ execute and differentiate multiplications 
        directly and does not use this identity! This identity is used here for 
        explanatory purpose, only.)
      - _division_ (via _multiplication_):  ![file_inline_9_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_9_0.png) 
        (__note__: __cycADa__ execute and differentiate divisions directly. 
        See __note__ on _multiplication_)

Thus in theory you may interpret the evaluation of such a vector-valued 
function  ![file_inline_10_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_10_0.png)  as a partially ordered 
vector of intermediate functions (each of them advancing by a 
single elementary operation)

![file_0](./.README_resources/img/file_0.png)

Here the  ![file_inline_11_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_11_0.png)  is the so called _data dependence relation_, 
i.e.  ![file_inline_12_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_12_0.png)  means that the computation of  ![file_inline_12_1](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_12_1.png)  requires 
the value of  ![file_inline_13_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_13_0.png)  beforehand. 
Some  ![file_inline_14_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_14_0.png)  have no dependencies in which case they are the independent 
inputs  ![file_inline_15_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_15_0.png)  of the function whereas 
some  ![file_inline_16_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_16_0.png)  have no successors in which case they are the 
final dependants  ![file_inline_17_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_17_0.png) . 
In [Grie2013](#Grie2013) rules for piecewise linearization have been proposed

![file_1](./.README_resources/img/file_1.png)

where  ![file_inline_18_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_18_0.png)  for two 
reference points  ![file_inline_19_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_19_0.png)  and 

![file_2](./.README_resources/img/file_2.png)

the secant-tangent slope of the elementary function  ![file_inline_20_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_20_0.png) . 

__note__: __cycADa__ rarely uses the secant-tangent slope formula directly but other 
optimized and so called 'singularity-free' formulas (see [Grie2018](#Grie2018) 
for more details).

Also in [Grie2013](#Grie2013) it has been proven for this set of 
rules for piecewise linearization that

![file_3](./.README_resources/img/file_3.png)

where  ![file_inline_21_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_21_0.png)  is a function evaluation
and  ![file_inline_22_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_22_0.png)  is
the so called _increment_. This statement simplifies further into the well known 
_Theorem of Taylor for first order expansions_ namely

![file_4](./.README_resources/img/file_4.png)

whenever  ![file_inline_23_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_23_0.png)  coalesce.

__note__: If the function  ![file_inline_24_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_24_0.png)  does not 
involve any absolute value operation then it already is differentiable in the classical 
meaning of _Fr√©chet Differentiability_, i.e.  ![file_inline_25_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_25_0.png) .
In that case we already find the increment

![file_5](./.README_resources/img/file_5.png)

actually to be a secant or tangent directional derivative, 
where  ![file_inline_26_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_26_0.png)  either 
is a secant matrix (if  ![file_inline_27_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_27_0.png) ) or the 
Jacobian (if  ![file_inline_28_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_28_0.png) ) of  ![file_inline_28_1](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_28_1.png) .

Because it is often necessary to compute many increments  ![file_inline_29_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_29_0.png)  in
various directions  ![file_inline_30_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_30_0.png)  for a fixed choice the reference 
points  ![file_inline_31_0](./.README_resources/img/file_inline_31_0.png)  (e.g. for a generalized or piecewise differentiable
Newton method, see [Grie2018](#Grie2018)), 
__cycADa__ can compute secant or tangent piecewise linear operators

![file_6](./.README_resources/img/file_6.png)

referred to as _Abs-Linear Form_ or _ALF_ (in older literature still _Abs-Normal Form_ or _ANF_)
that generalize the idea of secant or Jacobian matrices of a function. For more discussions
regarding the concept of _ALF_ see [Grie2015](#Grie2015) or [Streub2014](#Streub2014).
For another example on how to use piecewise linearization to integrate a system of 
ordinary differential equations with picewise differentiable 
right-hand-side system function (ODE) see [GrHa2018](#GrHa2018).

## <a name="install">On the Installation</a>

__note:__ This installation process was successful many times on __Ubuntu__. 
Someone gave positive feedback for installing on __MacOs__. 
There is no experience for __Windows__ so far!

Make sure to have the following dependencies installed:
 * __cython__
 * __g++__ 
 * __boost__ (c++ libraries)
 * __numpy__
 * __scipy__
 * __pyyaml__

There is a __Makefile__ organizing the installation process:
 1. open __bash__ (or any other shell)
 2. _cd_ your way to .../ad/cycADa/
 3. _execute_ or _call_
    
        make
    
    and follow the instructions

Alternatively (and since there is a setup.py) you can install __cycADa__ e.g.
as you wish and need.

## <a name="post_install">Just after the Installation</a>

Once the __Makefile__ completed its task __cycADa__ is ready to 
use already (-> check .../ad/cycADa/examples).
if you want to use __cycADa__ within your project you will need to 
add __cycADa__ (or more specifically the parent folder of 'ad/') to the __PYTHONPATH__ 
in some way or another. In case you want to extend the __PYTHONPATH__ variable
manually you can e.g. follow:
  
 4. open __bash__
 5. _execute_:
     
        export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/<path parent folder of 'ad/'>/"
