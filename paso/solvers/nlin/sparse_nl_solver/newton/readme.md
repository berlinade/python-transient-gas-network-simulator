# Newton solver and Homotopy sub-package

solves the mathematical "root problem": 

    find x*: f(x*) = 0, where f: IR^m -> IR^(m + n), with m > 0 and n >= 0

### future ideas to expand this package:
 - use broyden and/or other quasi Newton updates whenever jacobian is fixed
 - (work with Jacobian-Vector-Products as alternative to Jacobian matrices)?

### author information
should be taken from each file individually
